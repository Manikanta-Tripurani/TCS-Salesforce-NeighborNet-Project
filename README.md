What is this project?
This project is building an application called NeighborNet. Its purpose is to create a trusted online space where people in a local community can trade skills and services without using money. For example, a member could offer an hour of gardening help in exchange for someone helping them fix their computer. The ultimate goal is to build a stronger, more collaborative neighborhood.
This project is being developed as part of the TCS Last Mile SmartBridge program.
The Problem We're Solving üò•
In most communities, people want to help each other, but they often rely on chaotic social media groups. This creates several problems: important offers get lost, it's hard to find someone with a specific skill, and there's no way to track the positive impact of these exchanges. NeighborNet aims to fix this.
Our Solution: How NeighborNet Helps ‚ú®
NeighborNet provides one organized, central platform that turns this chaos into a structured system. It allows members to easily post what they can offer and what they need help with. The platform then helps connect the right people, tracks every successful "swap," and shows the positive activity happening in the community.
Key Features
üë§ Member & Skill Profiles: A central directory where members can list their unique skills and talents.
üì¢ Offer & Request Board: An easy-to-use board for posting and browsing available services and needs.
ü§ù Exchange Tracking: A system to manage the entire lifecycle of a swap‚Äîfrom the initial agreement to the final completion.
ü§ñ Automated Notifications: Automatic alerts to notify users of potential matches or updates on their ongoing exchanges.
üìä Community Dashboard: Simple charts and reports to visualize the most popular skills and the overall engagement within the network.
